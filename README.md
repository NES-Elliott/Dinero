# Dinero

**Dinero** is a full stack expense tracking application. You can put in the expense's name and set a positive or negative amount. Your balance will then be calculated accordingly as either an income or an expense and everything is calculated into a balance. This app uses the MERN stack: Mongo to store the data, Express to run the server, React on our front-end, and Node.js on the back-end. Dinero also uses axios to make request and mongoose to easily use MongoDB.

## How To Use
---

To use Dinero, just type in your income/expense and positive or negative number to go with it.

Hit the button to send it in and it will save the data to the database.
